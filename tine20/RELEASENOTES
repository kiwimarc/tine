=====================
                    
  Release:     TBA (2019.11)
  Last change: 2018-11-21

GENERAL CHANGES
---

* Minimum PHP Version: 7.0

* PHP 7.3 is now supported

* MySQL with UTF8 MB4 charset

We changed the default charset to UTF8MB4. All tables in the Tine 2.0 Database can be converted using a CLI method.
This requires either MySQL 5.7.7+ or MariaDB 10.2.2+ with default settings. Earlier versions are supported
 with non default settings. MySQL 5.6+ and MariaDB 10.0+ need to set:
    innodb_large_prefix = 1
    innodb_file_format = 'Barracuda'
    innodb_file_per_table = 'ON'
The conversion script will test these settings and abort if prerequisites are not met.
the CLI method to convert to utf8mb4 is "setup.php --migrateUtf8mb4"

* Enforcing table structure of addressbook, container and applications

PLEASE NOTE: if your table structure of those three tables does not match exactly
 the tine20 intended structure, that structure will be enforced on those 3 tables.
 Columns and indexes will be dropped or altered to exactly match the tine20 intended
 structure.

More Models will be converted to this soon. We call it "Model Configuration Version 2"

* System-Customfields

Customfields that are added directly to the record table schema.

MAILFILER
---

* The MailFiler module has been removed because most of the functionality is in Filemanager and more
 will be added soon. It will live on as community module in https://github.com/tine20/tine20/tree/community_apps
