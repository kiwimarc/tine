GENERAL CHANGES
---

* Minimum PHP Version: 7.0

* PHP 7.3 is now supported

* Enforcing table structure of addressbook, container and applications

PLEASE NOTE: if your table structure of those three tables does not match exactly
 the tine20 intended structure, that structure will be enforced on those 3 tables.
 Columns and indexes will be dropped or altered to exactly match the tine20 intended
 structure.

More Models will be converted to this soon. We call it "Model Configuration Version 2"

* System-Customfields

Customfields that are added directly to the record table schema.

MAILFILER

* The MailFiler module has been removed because most of the functionality is in Filemanager and more
 will be added soon. It will live on as community module in https://github.com/tine20/tine20/tree/community_apps
